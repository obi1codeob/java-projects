# 99 Bottles of Beer

This is a simple Java program that prints the lyrics to the classic song, "99 Bottles of Beer."

## üç∫ How It Works

The program starts with 99 bottles and then uses a `while` loop to decrement the number of bottles, printing the corresponding verse for each number. It also handles the grammatical change from "bottles" to "bottle" when there is only one left. The loop continues until there are no more bottles remaining.
