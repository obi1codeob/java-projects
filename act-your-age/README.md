# HealthData – Age in Days Calculator

## Overview

**HealthData** is a simple Java console application that calculates a user's approximate age in **days**, based on the age they enter in **years**.

This program is intended as a basic example of variable assignment, user input, and arithmetic operations in Java. It demonstrates how to convert years into days using a fixed multiplier (365 days/year), which provides an estimate of a user's age in days.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This program does **not** account for leap years. It assumes every year has exactly 365 days.
